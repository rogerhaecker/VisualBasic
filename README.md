# VisualBasic
Repository for Visual Basic projects!

I did some programming in basic languages in grade school and high school. When I started programming in college, this was the first language I learned. When I earned my Bachlors degree in Software Development we learned Java and C#.

I really enjoyed Basic and Visual Basic and would like to relearn how to do this.
